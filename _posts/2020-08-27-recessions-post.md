### It is often said we can't predict the weather. This may be true but at the same time, it is possible to predict the seasons. After Spring comes Summer and after Autumn comes Winter. My first chart depicts the seasonality of a developed United States economy and instead of using seasons I named these four quadrants 'Regimes'. Unlike the seasons these Regimes never need to happen in a particular order but there are predictable measures that the U.S. Federal Reserve is willing to take if GDP (a measure of growth) and CPI (a measure of inflation) are accelerating or decelerating. Throw a bit of Treasury bonds in the mix and the question is...How does this all relate to a recession?
